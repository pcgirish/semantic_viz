# Security Skill

Use this whenever you're writing auth, handling user data, touching any
security boundary, or asked to audit the codebase's security.

## Password / Secret Handling
- Hash passwords with bcrypt, cost factor ≥ 12
- Use cryptographically secure RNG for tokens — never uuid4()
- Never log, return, or serialize password hashes
- Secrets in environment / config only — never in code or comments

## Input Validation
- Validate all inputs at system boundaries before use
- Never use string interpolation in SQL — ORM or parameterized queries only
- Validate and sanitize string lengths on all user-facing fields

## OWASP Top 10
- [ ] Injection: ORM only, no raw SQL with user input
- [ ] Broken auth: token expiry, rotation, rate limiting
- [ ] Sensitive data: no secrets in logs, responses, or git
- [ ] XSS: escape output, set CSP headers
- [ ] IDOR: ownership check on every resource
- [ ] Security misconfiguration: .env never committed

## Full Security Audit
When explicitly asked for a security audit, work through:
1. Search for hardcoded secrets, tokens, or passwords in all files
2. Verify all DB queries go through the ORM (no raw SQL with user input)
3. Confirm .env is in .gitignore and not committed
4. Verify the soft-delete pattern is used (no hard DELETEs)
5. Report findings as: CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW
